The React URL Shortener is a small web app where you:

Type a long URL (like https://google.com).

Click the Shorten button.

The app creates a short link (like http://short.ly/abc123).

It shows the original link, the short link, and when it was created.

You can click the short link to open the original website.

It is made using React.js with simple input, button, and a list to show the links.
